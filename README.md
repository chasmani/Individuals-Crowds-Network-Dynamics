# PRIVATE_robust_benefits_of_social_exchange

Code, data and visualisations. 

## Analytic Functions

The main important functions are included in python (robust_benefits.py).

This includes functions to get the asymptotic changes in crowd and indivdiual errror in terms of influence-bias correlations, and alternative functions to find the changes in error in terms of herding/heterodoxy and wisdom/foolishness. 

## Tests

We include tests of the analytic functions against simulations, in robust_benefits_tests.py. The simulation code is in robust_benefits_sim.py.

## Plots

Functions for plotting results are in the plots folder, which also contains saved plots in the images folder. 

## Archive

This is an archive of code used during development of the main ideas. We included it for reference purposes.
